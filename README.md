# Break-Out

# Project Description
This is a homework assignment from a class I took at Macalester College. I was given no starter code. The assigment is to recreate the game Breakout. The objective of the game is to hit the ball with a paddle until all the bricks on the screen are gone. If the ball travels under the paddle the player loses 1 life. When the player has no lives left, they lose the game. Players start with 5 lives.
